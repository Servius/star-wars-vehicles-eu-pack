Put this file in lua/entities/
Then package up the addon like normal and upload.
Now you need to set your addon on the upload page, to require my addon.
This way the only thing in your addon is the unique files, and should I make any changes to fighter_base and the sounds etc. you'll get those changes.
 
Make sure this is the only file in lua/entities/
